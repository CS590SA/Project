## Abstract
The purpose of this project is to study implementation of software product line architectures. In domain specific software engineering, software product lines may be exploited to take advantage of software architecture and code reusability. Extracting from software architecture a set of commonalities and desired features, a single software product may be reused to implement many subset products. This paper presents the findings from a case study where a single code base is used to produce a subset of product line architectures.
